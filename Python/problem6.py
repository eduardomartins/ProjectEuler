# Sum square difference
#
# The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,
#              1^2 + 2^2 + .... + 10^2 = 385
# The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,
#               (1 + 2 + ... + 10)^2 = 55^2 = 3025
#  Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers
#  and the square of the sum is 3025 âˆ’ 385 = 2640.
#  Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural
#  numbers and the square of the sum.

#                                                         Names scores
#
# Using names.txt (right click and 'Save Link/Target As...'), a 46K text file containing
# over five-thousand first names, begin by sorting it into alphabetical order.
# Then working out the alphabetical value for each name, multiply this value by its
# alphabetical position in the list to obtain a name score.
# For example, when the list is sorted into alphabetical order, COLIN, which is
# worth 3 + 15 + 12 + 9 + 14 = 53, is the 938th name in the list. So, COLIN would
# obtain a score of 938 Ã— 53 = 49714.
# What is the total of all the name scores in the file?

ALPHABETICAL = 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'
